            "2007, the Stanford University News Service published an article that reported a remarkable discovery by NLP researchers at Stanford. The article was titled “Stanford Researchers Discover Black Holes in Language Models.” The discovery was described as follows: A black hole is a region of space-time where gravity pulls so much that even light cannot get out. Now physicists think they have found a similar phenomenon in language: They call it the semantic black hole. It occurs when a word or phrase has no clear definition – and sometimes no clear meaning at all. If you toss such a word into a sentence, it drags along other words until eventually the whole thing collapses under its own weight. “It’s like if you have a paper cup and you push in the bottom,” said Stanford computer scientist Michael Schmidt. “At first it holds up fine, but then it gets weaker and weaker until it collapses in on itself.” Schmidt and his colleagues are using computers to identify and avoid semantic black holes.\n",
